To do the problem set, or not to do the problem set - that is the double-starred red question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to bear the constant mental applied force of
The range equations of slings and arrows, the natural laws that cause outrageous fortune
Or to take pens against an endless sea of problems,
And by applying an equal and opposing force, end them. To sleep- to rest-
To draw force diagrams no more; and by at rest to say we have no more velocity
The headaches, the long, sleepless nights, and the thousand forces
That physics students are heir to. 'Tis a ending to the seemingly endless pain
Devoutly to be wish'd. To sleep- to rest.
To rest- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
For in that comfort of sleep, what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this problem set strife,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so hard a physics class.
For who would bear the horrors of AP Physics C,
Th' teacher’s insistence, the smart man's success,
The pangs of loathed rotation problems, the test grader’s delay,
The plummeting of grades, and the spurns
That desperate merit of th' genius takes,
When he himself might his final problem set make
With a mere guidance visit? Who would continue to bear the burden,
To grunt and cry and sharpen pencils under a sleepless life,
But that the dread of something without physics-
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No force equation applies- puzzles the mind,
And makes us rather bear this problem set we have
Than fly to some other class that we know not of?
Thus physics does make cowards of us all,
And thus the immediate problem set
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thoughts of physics,
And enterprises of great genius and sweat equity
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of physics.- Soft you now!
The masterful Shaw!- Sage, in thy gradings

Be all my mathematical errors and sig fig errors and my forgotten units and my lack of work be forgiven
